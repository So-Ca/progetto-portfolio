<h1>Portfolio</h1>

<h2>HTML & CSS project for start2impact</h2>

<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>
  This project consist in the creation of portfolio using HTML&CSS language.<br>
  I've try to keep a minimal and modern style.<br>
  The site is made with a fixed navbar above that allows you to navigate between the three pages: Home, Project and About.<br>
  In the central section there is the content that I want to show, and at the bottom there is a bar that contains my personal information.
</p>

<h3>Table of contents</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Structure</li>
  <li>Overview</li>
  <li>Responsive</li>
  <li>Contacts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>I chose some specific font:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Audiowide</li>
  <p>Used for titles</p>
  <li>Rajdhani</li>
  <p>Used for links, form and subtitles</p>
  <li>Roboto Flex</li>
  <p>Used for paragraph</p>
  <li>Finger Paint</li>
  <p>Used for work in progress stuff</p>
</ul>

<p>and palette:</p>

<ul>
  <p>The main ones</p>
  <li>#1475BC</li>
  <li>#364B5F</li>
  <li>#75797C</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <p>The secondary</p>
  <li>#FFFFFF</li>
  <li>#000000</li>
  <li>#03459C</li>
  <li>#FF5757</li>
  <li>#FF914C</li>
  <li>#D2EDF7</li>
  <li>#008036</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
I chose to make the website in a main page called "home" and with other two pages: "About" and "Project".<br>
Inside the "About" page there is a little overview about me and some contacts information.<br>
The "Project" page is still work in progress and it will be updated with my new works.
</p>
<p>
The home page begins with an hexagons structure that contains an essential description of what my characteristics and my interests are. These hexagons are clickable and 
refer to a detailed explanation.<br>
At the end of the page there is a simple form to contact me.<br>
I've used from Bootstrap just the navbar.<br>
Both in the favicon and the footer I've put a little logo that refer to the style of the project and contains my initials.
